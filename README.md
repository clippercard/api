# 2015 Clipper Card API

This is an attempt to document the current Clipper Card API, as implemented on their website and in clippercard-python and clippercard-ruby. Because the clipper card doesn't have an open documented API, this is done by trial and error, and as such will most likely have wrong info at times. Please be aware. 

Any information you have regarding the clipper card API would be welcomed through a pull request.
